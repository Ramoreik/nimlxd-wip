# nimlxd-wip
Welcome to the very in-development LXD client for Nim.

! This is a learning projet to learn about LXD and Nim !
There is a disclaimer in the NimLXD file.

The main goal is to create a usable pure nim lxd client.
For now, features will come pretty much as I need them, unless someone helps !

My first goals are : 

- Interface with instances (excluding interactive for now, but it would be interesting)
- Interface with images
- Interface with networks
- Add a fun layer of abstraction
- efficiently manage a moderate scale practice of LXD

If you're angry at my code, please contribute <3
Or if you want to fork this off into a better project coded by actual nim-mancers, feel free to do so.
